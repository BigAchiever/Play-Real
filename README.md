# Play Real

I am thrilled to present my latest creation: a captivating gaming application developed using Flutter and Dart, with the seamless integration of Supabase for Facebook authentication. The inspiration for this game struck me while observing the joyous gatherings of families and friends, where everyone, regardless of age, was engrossed in mobile gaming. I wanted to create an app that would not only entertain but also promote physical activity and create memorable moments for all.

With this vision in mind, I have designed an immersive gaming experience that aims to engage people of all ages. My app encourages players to get up, move around, and have a fantastic time together. By incorporating Supabase for Facebook authentication, I have made it easy for users to log in and access the game with their existing social media accounts, eliminating the need for tedious registration processes..
